# Meep-Simulations
Simulations from 3rd year research project

- These are the series of simulations I wrote in python using the MEEP module
- They are FDTD simulations of light trasmission through a bacteria (Synechochystis)
- The majority of the simulations are 2D simulations that I used to build my model before committing it to 3D

- The novelty of these simulations are that:
    - First time anyone had looked at a 3D bacterial model
    - First time a thylakoid and cytoplasm had been modelled independently (using refractive indicies)
    - A very primitive model of absorption had been implemented however this needed more work that my time allowed
